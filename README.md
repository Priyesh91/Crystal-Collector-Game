# Crystal Collector Game

https://priyesh91.github.io/Crystal-Collector-Game/

This project uses JavaScript along with jQuery to demonstrate use of logic.

The user interfaces with 4 crystals on the game board, where each crystal is given a random hidden value per each game. The user then attempts to click on the crystals and reduce a magic number to exactly zero to win, otherwise a loss will be registered.
